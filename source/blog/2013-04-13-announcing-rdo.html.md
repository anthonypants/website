Today, we are releasing OpenStack Grizzly packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 and clones,  and Fedora 18.

And to help you make the most of OpenStack, we've created this site so you can:

* Connect with fellow OpenStack users on the [mailing lists](https://www.rdoproject.org/contribute/mailing-lists/) or in the #rdo channel on the [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) server;
* [Get started](/install/packstack/) with the latest OpenStack project software, packaged and ready to use on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Scientific Linux, Fedora, and other RHEL derivatives and Fedora remixes;
* Read and improve on our [documentation](https://www.rdoproject.org/use/), check the [troubleshooting page](/troubleshooting/) if you have any issues, and consider adding your OpenStack set-up as a [case study](/user-stories)

If you have any questions, take a look at our [Ask and Answer](https://www.rdoproject.org/contribute/#ask-and-answer) section of the site. And if you see a great nugget of information you want to share with others, feel free to send it to the [mailing lists](https://www.rdoproject.org/contribute/mailing-lists/). As always, it's the community behind open source projects that makes them great and we are excited to invite everyone in.

Thanks, and have fun with OpenStack!
